# FinalProject-Stat-Comp
Stat133 (Statistical Computing) Final Project on Predicting the 2012 election results.

This the final project for Stat133 (Statistical Computing) at UC Berkeley for the 
Fall 2014 semester.

The goal is too use the 2010 census and 2004 presedential 
election results by county, to predict the 2012 presidential election results 
by county. We try the kth-nearest neighbor algortihm and recursive partioning to 
make these predictions.
